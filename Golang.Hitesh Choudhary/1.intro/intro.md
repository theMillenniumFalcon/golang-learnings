- Complied:
    - Go tool can run directly, without VM.
    - Executables are exported at the compiled time.
    - Executables are different for OS.
- What:
    - System apps to web apps - Cloud.
- Object oriented:
    - Yes and No
    - What you see on the screen is the code.
- Missing:
    - try/catch
    - Lexer does a lot of work
- Lexer: The job of Lexer is to simply understand that you are following the grammar of the language. So that the syntax is corrrect, the variables defined are done properly or not. So, before the precompilation of the language happens, lexer goes and checks if the rules are followed correctly or not.
- Types:
    - Case insensitive; almost.
    - Variable type should be known in advance.
    - Almost everything is a Type.
        - String
        - Bool
        - integer --> ( unit8, unit64, int8, int64, unitptr ) --> aliases are involved too
        - Floating --> float32, float64
        - Complex
        - array
        - Slices
        - Map
        - Structs
        - Pointers
        - Functions internally are also treated as types
